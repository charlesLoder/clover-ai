## Getting Started

There are many ways to contribute to the project. Code is just one possible means of contribution.

- **Feedback**. Tell us what we're doing well or where we can improve.
- **Support**. If you need help, submit a new issue.
- **Write**. If you come up with an interesting example, write about it. Post it to your blog and share it with us. We'd love to see what folks in the community build!
- **Report**. Create issues with bug reports so we can make this tool even better.

## Creating a Pull Request

The simplest way is to follow Github's pattern of creating a [pull request from a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

## Code Style

Follow the [stlye guide](./STYLEGUIDE.md), which can also be used as context for an agent.

Though not commit style is enforced (e.g. conventional commits), write clear, descriptive commit messages

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. Ensure your PR has a clear title and description
2. Link any relevant issues
3. Make sure all tests pass
4. Request review from maintainers
5. Address any feedback promptly
